# PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN IN E-COMMERCE
# Churn Guard: A Predictive Model for Telecommunication Consumer Retention

**"Stay Ahead. Know Who Will Leave Before They Do."**

---

##  Project Overview

**Churn Guard** is a machine learning classification model built to **predict customer churn** in the **telecommunication industry**. Leveraging historical data and behavioral features, the model provides insights that help telecom providers identify at-risk customers **before they leave**.

By combining real-world data analytics with predictive modeling, **Churn Guard** helps telecom businesses protect their revenue, retain loyal customers, and sharpen their strategic decisions.

---

##  Real-World Motivation

Numerous companies have suffered **massive losses** due to failing to analyze customer behavior:

- **Sprint (U.S.)** lost over **$1.6 billion in churn-related costs** in a single year, partly due to poor retention analytics.
- **MTN Nigeria** saw a **loss of 6 million subscribers in 2017**, citing poor customer satisfaction and market competition.
- **BlackBerry**, once dominant in telecom hardware, lost market relevance due to ignoring behavioral trends and user experience needs.

> Studies show it can cost **5–7 times more** to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.  
> Predictive churn modeling can improve retention by **up to 15–25%**, directly boosting profitability.

##  Key Features Used in This Project

Below are some of the features selected from the dataset and how they may affect customer churn:

| Feature               | Description                                                               | Potential Impact on Churn |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `tenure`              | Number of months the customer has been with the company                   | Lower tenure = higher churn risk |
| `MonthlyCharges`      | The monthly fee charged to the customer                                   | High charges can increase dissatisfaction |
| `TotalCharges`        | Total revenue generated from the customer                                 | Low total charges may indicate short retention |
| `Contract`            | Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)                     | Month-to-month users churn more |
| `InternetService`     | Type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, None)                         | Fiber optic customers churn more if service is poor |
| `TechSupport`         | Whether the customer has technical support                                | Lack of support = higher churn likelihood |
| `PaymentMethod`       | Customer's payment method (e.g., Electronic check, Credit card)           | Electronic check users have higher churn tendency |
| `SeniorCitizen`       | Whether the customer is a senior citizen                                  | Seniors may churn due to service complexity |
