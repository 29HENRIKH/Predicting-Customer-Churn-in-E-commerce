# PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN IN E-COMMERCE
Churn Guard
Stay Ahead. Know Who Will Leave Before They Do.
📊 Project Overview
Churn Guard is a machine learning classification model built to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. It helps companies detect customers at risk of leaving, empowering them to act proactively before churn impacts their revenue and brand.

Built using data from a real-world telecom company, this model applies supervised learning techniques (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to understand the patterns that influence customer retention.

🚨 Why This Model Matters
Real-World Failure: The Cost of Ignoring Consumer Behavior
T-Mobile (2017–2019): Lost over $200 million in churn-related customer turnover before investing in advanced churn prediction analytics.

Sprint (2015): Reported churn rates exceeding 2.3%, resulting in an estimated $1.3 billion in annual lost revenue.

Nokia's downfall (2010–2013): Though not strictly churn, Nokia failed to read shifting consumer behaviors and lost market dominance, costing them billions.

Ignoring churn and behavioral patterns can be catastrophic — not only in profit loss, but also in brand erosion, operational costs, and market share decline.

👥 Who Can Benefit from This Model?
📈 Telecom Product Managers – Improve customer engagement and reduce attrition

📞 Call Center Managers – Target retention strategies based on churn scores

📊 Data Scientists & Analysts – Build and integrate churn insights into dashboards

💼 Executives & Business Strategists – Align decisions with customer behavior trends

🧑‍💻 AI/ML Students – Learn end-to-end classification modeling using real data

🌟 Benefits to the Telecom Industry
🔎 Early Churn Detection – Predict potential leavers before they decide to quit

🎯 Targeted Campaigns – Run personalized offers to high-risk users

💰 Revenue Protection – Retaining existing customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones

📉 Reduced Operational Waste – Stop spending on low-return marketing to loyal users

🤝 Increased Customer Satisfaction – Improve service for those most at risk

🧠 Features That Influence Churn
Some of the key features used in training the model include:

Feature	How It Affects Churn
tenure	Shorter tenure often means higher likelihood to churn
MonthlyCharges	High monthly charges may discourage price-sensitive users
Contract	Month-to-month contracts have higher churn risk
PaymentMethod	Customers using electronic checks tend to churn more
TechSupport	Lack of tech support access correlates with high churn
InternetService	Fiber vs DSL shows different churn rates
SeniorCitizen	Older users may have distinct retention patterns

These features reflect consumer behavior — such as dissatisfaction with pricing, service limitations, or contract flexibility — which are key churn indicators.
